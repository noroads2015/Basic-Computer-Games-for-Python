# Basic Computer Games for Python
 Python version of Basic Computer Games by David Ahl

Basic COmputer Games is a book published in 1978.
A second book, More Basic Computer Games was published in 1979

These two books were a compilation of programs written in the BASIC language, originally published in the magazine, Creative Computing.

This repository is a translation from BASIC into Python.  Some programs will be translated in a more-or-less line for line manner.  Some will follow the same logic, but written in a more efficient way, and some will be a complete rewrite of the game.

The games in the book were written to be displayed as text on the screen or printed to a printer.  Most of the Python transaltions are meant to be played in the terminal, but some will use a GUI or PyGame.
